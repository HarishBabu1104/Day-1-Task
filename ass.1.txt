HTTP1.1:

>Hyper text transfer protocol.
>It is introduced in 1997.
>Internet landscape was constantly changing with websites becoming more dynamic and heavy.
>Features like CORS,keep alive,support was introduced in this update.

Flaws:
>HOL -Head of line blocking.
>Repeatition of Header data.
>more focus on compression,caching,minifying CSS/JS,gzip,etc.

Working:
>If we request for an index.html and waits till it recieves the response.
>Then it will request for JS,recieve response back.
>Then it will request for CSS,return with an response.

HTTP2.0:

>Introduced in 2015.
>HTTP2 is an HTTP1.1 connection with some additional features.
>One second TCP connection is setup in which HTTP request are transferred in form of streams.
>Single TCP connection pipline is used in which streams are created.
>It is kind of multiplexing of streams into one TCP.
>HPACK - Header data is sepreate from request data and can be zipped.
>HPACK - also enables reuse of header data whic is repeated in every request.
>HPACK reduces HTTP request size.
>Push frame - can be used at server side and it requires JS/CSS.
>Push frames enables us to send mandatory resources in advance along with an HTTP response.
>Push frames should be used with case as this can lead to increase in size of the HTTP response.
>Almost all tye modern web servers support this.

Overall:
Even though if the client dont support with HTTP2,the client will be served through HTTP1.1.

Objects and its internal representation in Javascript.
In javascript,an object is a standalone or group of entity,with properties and type.

creating objects in javascript:
1.Byobject literal.
2.By creating instance of object directly.

By object literal:
>The syntax of creating object directly using object literal is given below.

object = {property 1 :value 1,property 2 :value 2,....property N :value N}

property and value is separated by colon(:)

Example:
           var person ={
           fname : "xxx",
           lname : "yyy",
           age   : 25,
